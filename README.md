RapidMiner CREMIT Extension
=============================

This RapidMiner extension contains the Cyclic Reverese Moving Intervals Techniques method also known as CReMIT. CReMIT is an aggregation method originally used for systematically forming derived time series data from singular periodic time series. The theorem of this method was developed by Marton Edelenyi, Zoltan Podor and Laszlo Jereb in 2014. In practice, the method in RapidMiner is contained in a single operator, which forms the aggregation of attributes of the example set by involving attributes into multiple windows with periodically increasing sizes.

The source of the extension can be found at https://github.com/kissb/CREMIT_Extension . The source also contains a tutorial RapidMiner process (with comment text in the operators) as a file called “CREMIT_Extension_tutorial.rpm”.

RapidMiner CREMIT Extension was developed by University of West Hungary, Institute of Informatics and Economics as a part of TÁMOP 4.2.2.C-11/1/KONV/2012-0015 project.
